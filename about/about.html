          <h4>Hi, my name is idan elhassid.</h4>
          <p>
          a few years ago I began learning programming as well as systems engineering with a lot of emphasis on complex problem-solving,
          <br>
          <br>
          since then I have worked in many roles, and was a part of many unique projects as well as building many projects of my own.<br><br>I have noticed that the best flow-state, deep focus and satisfaction I have in my life is while building something special, something useful or while working on solving difficult problems.
          <br>
            <br>
            And that is why I have come to the realization that this is my path, passion, and what I want to do in life.
            <br>
